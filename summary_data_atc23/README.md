# Summary data from distributed traces

We include a [Jupyter notebook](./generate_figures.ipynb) that provides both the description of the data sets and the code to generate the charts used in the paper.

To run the notebook live:

```shell
# we recommend creating a local virtual environment for Python

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
